datetime-wrapper-lib
===
a library that wraps around the python datetime standard library. The reason for this library is because I found myself complaining about the user friendlyness of the datetime python library, so I made a wrapper around it to fix my concerns.

# Installing the library locally
To install the library to your local machine simply run the following command:
```s
$ pip3 install -e git+https://github.com/vinturnier/datetime-wrapper-lib.git@master#egg=dt_wrapper
```
